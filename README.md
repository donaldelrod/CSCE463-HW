Homework assignments from a High Performance Networking class I took at TAMU

## Assignment 1
Webcrawler - checks url(s) for existance, status codes and robots files, as well as counting links (can easily be modified to crawl all links found as well). Runs well up to ~800 threads
## Assignment 2
DNS Lookup - performs DNS lookups/reverse lookups on url(s) given the url/ip of the site and the ip of the name server
## Assignment 3
Reliable Data Transfer (primitive TCP file transfer) - (multi-threaded version needs a bit of work, but single threaded gets speeds up to ~800 mbps)
## Assignment 4
Parallel Traceroute - like traceroute but parallel (needs to be fixed, but almost works)
